        <img id="mirael1" src="mirael1.jfif" alt="AFK Arena Mirael"><br>
        This is Mirael, specifically AFK Arena Mirael. She's a starting game fire mage, and one of my favorite heros in the game, which was designed by Lilith games.<br>
        <img id="mirael2" src="mirael2.jfif" alt="AFK Journey Mirael"><br>
        This is her design in the new game, AFK Journey. I really like how they made her look more mature and refined. It matches her personality much more.<br>
        <img id="mirael3" src="mirael3.jfif" alt="AFK Journey Mirael Skin"><br>
        This is her skin, Scarlet Vow, one of the first in the game. I think its interesting how it looks so much like a wedding dress, especially since she doesnt have a romantic interest, however I think its just a fancy inverse design.
